Mages is designed to be used as a general canvas to build math applets for HTML5-based educational software.  The current goal is to develop the widgets necessary to build a 4th grade curriculum.  Mages is currently in an alpha state, and no support for its use is offered by the author, Jeffrey Gordon.  Use it at your own risk.

This demo video shows how Mages is used to build math applets.  In it, Mages creator Jeffrey Gordon walks through the steps to create three math applets: an addition applet, a bar graph applet, and a number line applet.
