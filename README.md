Mages is designed to be used as a general canvas to build math applets for HTML5-based educational software.  Mages is currently in an alpha state, and no support for its use is offered by the author, Jeffrey Gordon.  Use it at your own risk.

This demo video shows how Mages is used to build math applets.  In it, Mages creator Jeffrey Gordon walks through the steps to create three math applets: an addition applet, a bar graph applet, and a number line applet.

Mages is also a game.  It is a spaceship battle RPG that includes the applet challenges, guided by an adaptive algorithm.

The public version of Mages is hosted [here](https://mages.firebaseapp.com/).
