		<p>Opengameart.org user Skorpio's Spaceship Construction Kits were used to create the spaceships that appear in the animated sequences.</p>
		<p>Mages is designed to be used as a general canvas to build math applets for HTML5-based educational software.  The current goal is to develop the widgets necessary to build a 4th grade curriculum.  Mages is currently in an alpha state, and no support for its use is offered by the author, Jeffrey Gordon.  Use it at your own risk.</p>
